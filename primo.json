It is not recommended to directly confront the person who is the subject of the report before notifying one of the leaders.\n\nThe misconduct procedure will be exercised in a way that will ensure any person(s) complaining has/have the opportunity to be heard and treated fairly, and that the complaint will remain confidential to the parties involved and the Charismata steering committee. An investigation lead by two or more members of the Charismata steering committee will be launched. If the harassment, or suspected harassment, continues during the investigative phase, immediate action will be taken to stop this conduct and protect any potential victim(s). Where there is any concern that the misconduct could be an indictable offense, the complainant(s) will be supported in contacting the police. At any point of investigation/intervention, all parties have the right to have an advocate and/or whānau/family support person present.\n\nThe person who is the subject of the report will be informed in writing, early in the investigative phase, by one of the steering committee that a complaint has been made, though the identity of the complainant(s) may be withheld at their request. Where the committee deems they are unable to conduct the investigation impartially, or that such an investigation would be beyond the scope of competence of its members, they may choose a suitable, experienced professional (e.g., a mediator with experience in misconduct) to lead the investigation with the assistance of one of the steering committee members.\n\nBoth the complainant(s) and the person who is the subject of the complaint will be kept informed of the progress of the investigation by a steering committee member/leader. Both parties will be allowed to state their case to the investigators in person, and/or in writing. Both parties will be encouraged to seek outside support during the process (e.g., counselling).\n\nAfter the completion of the investigation, a written report will be sent to all involved parties. If harassment is deemed to have occurred, or may be reasonably suspected to have occurred, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken. The complainant(s) may be consulted on the topic of suitable (and if possible/appropriate, restorative) disciplinary action, which can then be proposed to the perpetrator of the misconduct for consideration.\n\n## Anti-Retaliation and False Allegations Policy\n\nCharismata prohibits retaliation made against any member, volunteer, or other person associated with our organisation who lodges a good faith complaint of harassment or who participates in any related investigation or disciplinary action. Charismata also prohibits making false or malicious harassment allegations, as well as deliberately providing false information during an investigation. Anyone who violates this rule is subject to disciplinary action and termination of membership.\n\n"}}},"page":"c7dad5e2-5fcf-4b2d-9abf-f16a82e6adca","symbol":"d928cfd4-cbaf-4e09-9f43-08f7cf69482b","index":1},{"id":"659df7c3-5e62-4188-9f59-97912b95bdc5","content":{},"page":"c7dad5e2-5fcf-4b2d-9abf-f16a82e6adca","symbol":"2b567be0-0fb8-42b5-b66a-64fb464304ab","index":2}],"symbols":[{"id":"4dc1ca97-6bc8-409c-85bc-33a970fd6967","name":"Call
